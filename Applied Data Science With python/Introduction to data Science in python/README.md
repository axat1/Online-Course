**Week 1**

      In this week you'll get an introduction to the field of data science, review common Python functionality
    and features which data scientists use, and be introduced to the Coursera Jupyter Notebook for the lectures. 
    All of the course information on grading, prerequisites, and expectations are on the course syllabus, 
    and you can find more information about the Jupyter Notebooks on our Course Resources page.

**Week 2**

      In this week of the course you'll learn the fundamentals of one of the most important toolkits Python has 
    for data cleaning and processing -- pandas. You'll learn how to read in data into DataFrame structures, 
    how to query these structures, and the details about such structures are indexed. 
    The module ends with a programming assignment and a discussion question.

**Week 3**

      In this week you'll deepen your understanding of the python pandas library by learning how to merge DataFrames,
    generate summary tables, group data into logical pieces, and manipulate dates. We'll also refresh your understanding 
    of scales of data, and discuss issues with creating metrics for analysis. The week ends with a more significant 
    programming assignment.

**Week 4**

      In this week of the course you'll be introduced to a variety of statistical techniques such a distributions, 
    sampling and t-tests. The majority of the week will be dedicated to your course project, where you'll engage 
    in a real-world data cleaning activity and provide evidence for (or against!) a given hypothesis. 
    This project is suitable for a data science portfolio, and will test your knowledge of cleaning, merging, 
    manipulating, and test for significance in data. The week ends with two discussions of science and the 
    rise of the fourth paradigm -- data driven discovery

# Locality Sensitive Hashing

Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) provides for a fast, efficient approximate nearest neighbor search. The algorithm scales well with respect to the number of data points as well as dimensions.

In this assignment, you will
* Implement the LSH algorithm for approximate nearest neighbor search
* Examine the accuracy for different documents by comparing against brute force search, and also contrast runtimes
* Explore the role of the algorithmâ€™s tuning parameters in the accuracy of the method

The idea behind LSH is to translate the sign of our tf-idf scores into a binary index (1 or 0) by using seeing if our score falls above or below a randomly defined line. This <a href="http://ethen8181.github.io/machine-learning/recsys/content_based/lsh_text.html">link</a> is helpful for understanding LSH and our code in more detail.


LSH performs an efficient neighbor search by randomly partitioning all reference data points into different bins. Today we will build a popular variant of LSH known as <strong>random binary projection</strong>, which approximates cosine distance. There are other variants we could use for other choices of distance metrics.

"""**In summary**, similar data points will in general _tend to_ fall into _nearby_ bins, but that's all we can say about LSH. In a high-dimensional space such as text features, we often get unlucky with our selection of only a few random vectors such that dissimilar data points go into the same bin while similar data points fall into different bins. **Given a query document, we must consider all documents in the nearby bins and sort them according to their actual distances from the query.**

## Query the LSH model

Let us first implement the logic for searching nearby neighbors, which goes like this:
```
1. Let L be the bit representation of the bin that contains the query documents.
2. Consider all documents in bin L.
3. Consider documents in the bins whose bit representation differs from L by 1 bit.
4. Consider documents in the bins whose bit representation differs from L by 2 bits.
...
```

To obtain candidate bins that differ from the query bin by some number of bits, we use `itertools.combinations`, which produces all possible subsets of a given list. See [this documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.combinations) for details.
```
1. Decide on the search radius r. This will determine the number of different bits between the two vectors.
2. For each subset (n_1, n_2, ..., n_r) of the list [0, 1, 2, ..., num_vector-1], do the following:
   * Flip the bits (n_1, n_2, ..., n_r) of the query bin to produce a new bit vector.
   * Fetch the list of documents belonging to the bin indexed by the new bit vector.
   * Add those documents to the candidate set.
```

Each line of output from the following cell is a 3-tuple indicating where the candidate bin would differ from the query bin. For instance,
```
(0, 1, 3)
```
indicates that the candiate bin differs from the query bin in first, second, and fourth bits.

"""We see a similar trade-off between quality and performance: as the number of random vectors increases, the query time goes down as each bin contains fewer documents on average, but on average the neighbors are likewise placed farther from the query. On the other hand, when using a small enough number of random vectors, LSH becomes very similar brute-force search: Many documents appear in a single bin, so searching the query bin alone covers a lot of the corpus; then, including neighboring bins might result in searching all documents, just as in the brute-force approach."""

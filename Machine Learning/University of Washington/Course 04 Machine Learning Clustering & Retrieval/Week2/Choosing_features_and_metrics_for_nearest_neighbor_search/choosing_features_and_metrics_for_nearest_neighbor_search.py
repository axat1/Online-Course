"""When exploring a large set of documents -- such as Wikipedia, news articles, StackOverflow, etc. -- it can be useful to get a list of related material. To find relevant documents you typically
* Decide on a notion of similarity
* Find the documents that are most similar 

In the assignment you will
* Gain intuition for different notions of similarity and practice finding similar documents. 
* Explore the tradeoffs with representing documents using raw word counts and TF-IDF
* Explore the behavior of different distance metrics by looking at the Wikipedia pages most similar to President Obamaâ€™s page.

## TF-IDF to the rescue

Much of the perceived commonalities between Obama and Barrio were due to occurrences of extremely frequent words, such as "the", "and", and "his". So nearest neighbors is recommending plausible results sometimes for the wrong reasons. 

To retrieve articles that are more relevant, we should focus more on rare words that don't happen in every article. **TF-IDF** (term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency) is a feature representation that penalizes words that are too common.

"""Relative to the rest of Wikipedia, nearest neighbors of Obama are overwhemingly short, most of them being shorter than 300 words. The bias towards short articles is not appropriate in this application as there is really no reason to  favor short articles over long articles (they are all Wikipedia articles, after all). Many of the Wikipedia articles are 300 words or more, and both Obama and Biden are over 300 words long.

**Note**: For the interest of computation time, the dataset given here contains _excerpts_ of the articles rather than full text. For instance, the actual Wikipedia article about Obama is around 25000 words. Do not be surprised by the low numbers shown in the histogram.

**Note:** Both word-count features and TF-IDF are proportional to word frequencies. While TF-IDF penalizes very common words, longer articles tend to have longer TF-IDF vectors simply because they have more words in them.

To remove this bias, we turn to **cosine distances**:
$$
d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}) = 1 - \frac{\mathbf{x}^T\mathbf{y}}{\|\mathbf{x}\| \|\mathbf{y}\|}

Cosine distances let us compare word distributions of two articles of varying lengths.

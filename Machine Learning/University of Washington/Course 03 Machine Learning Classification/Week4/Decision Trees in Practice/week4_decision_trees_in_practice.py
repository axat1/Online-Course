# Decision Trees in Practice

In this assignment we will explore various techniques for preventing overfitting in decision trees. We will extend the implementation of the binary decision trees that we implemented in the previous assignment. You will have to use your solutions from this previous assignment and extend them.

In this assignment you will:

* Implement binary decision trees with different early stopping methods.
* Compare models with different stopping parameters.
* Visualize the concept of overfitting in decision trees.

Let's get started!

"""**Note:** There are many approaches for dealing with imbalanced data, including some where we modify the learning algorithm. These approaches are beyond the scope of this course, but some of them are reviewed in this [paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5128907&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fiel5%2F69%2F5173046%2F05128907.pdf%3Farnumber%3D5128907 ). For this assignment, we use the simplest possible approach, where we subsample the overly represented class to get a more balanced dataset. In general, and especially when the data is highly imbalanced, we recommend using more advanced methods.

## Transform categorical data into binary features

Since we are implementing **binary decision trees**, we transform our categorical data into binary data using 1-hot encoding, just as in the previous assignment. Here is the summary of that discussion:

For instance, the **home_ownership** feature represents the home ownership status of the loanee, which is either `own`, `mortgage` or `rent`. For example, if a data point has the feature 
```
   {'home_ownership': 'RENT'}
```
we want to turn this into three features: 
```
 { 
   'home_ownership = OWN'      : 0, 
   'home_ownership = MORTGAGE' : 0, 
   'home_ownership = RENT'     : 1
 }
```

Since this code requires a few Python and Turi Create tricks, feel free to use this block of code as is. Refer to the API documentation for a deeper understanding.

"""# Early stopping methods for decision trees

In this section, we will extend the **binary tree implementation** from the previous assignment in order to handle some early stopping conditions. Recall the 3 early stopping methods that were discussed in lecture:

1. Reached a **maximum depth**. (set by parameter `max_depth`).
2. Reached a **minimum node size**. (set by parameter `min_node_size`).
3. Don't split if the **gain in error reduction** is too small. (set by parameter `min_error_reduction`).

For the rest of this assignment, we will refer to these three as **early stopping conditions 1, 2, and 3**.

## Early stopping condition 1: Maximum depth

Recall that we already implemented the maximum depth stopping condition in the previous assignment. In this assignment, we will experiment with this condition a bit more and also write code to implement the 2nd and 3rd early stopping conditions.

We will be reusing code from the previous assignment and then building upon this.  We will **alert you** when you reach a function that was part of the previous assignment so that you can simply copy and past your previous code.

## Early stopping condition 2: Minimum node size

The function **reached_minimum_node_size** takes 2 arguments:

1. The `data` (from a node)
2. The minimum number of data points that a node is allowed to split on, `min_node_size`.

This function simply calculates whether the number of data points at a given node is less than or equal to the specified minimum node size. This function will be used to detect this early stopping condition in the **decision_tree_create** function.

Fill in the parts of the function below where you find `## YOUR CODE HERE`.  There is **one** instance in the function below.

## Early stopping condition 3: Minimum gain in error reduction

The function **error_reduction** takes 2 arguments:

1. The error **before** a split, `error_before_split`.
2. The error **after** a split, `error_after_split`.

This function computes the gain in error reduction, i.e., the difference between the error before the split and that after the split. This function will be used to detect this early stopping condition in the **decision_tree_create** function.

"""## Incorporating new early stopping conditions in binary decision tree implementation

Now, you will implement a function that builds a decision tree handling the three early stopping conditions described in this assignment.  In particular, you will write code to detect early stopping conditions 2 and 3.  You implemented above the functions needed to detect these conditions.  The 1st early stopping condition, **max_depth**, was implemented in the previous assigment and you will not need to reimplement this.  In addition to these early stopping conditions, the typical stopping conditions of having no mistakes or no more features to split on (which we denote by "stopping conditions" 1 and 2) are also included as in the previous assignment.

**Implementing early stopping condition 2: minimum node size:**

* **Step 1:** Use the function **reached_minimum_node_size** that you implemented earlier to write an if condition to detect whether we have hit the base case, i.e., the node does not have enough data points and should be turned into a leaf. Don't forget to use the `min_node_size` argument.
* **Step 2:** Return a leaf. This line of code should be the same as the other (pre-implemented) stopping conditions.


**Implementing early stopping condition 3: minimum error reduction:**

**Note:** This has to come after finding the best splitting feature so we can calculate the error after splitting in order to calculate the error reduction.

* **Step 1:** Calculate the **classification error before splitting**.  Recall that classification error is defined as:

$$
\text{classification error} = \frac{\text{# mistakes}}{\text{# total examples}}
$$
* **Step 2:** Calculate the **classification error after splitting**. This requires calculating the number of mistakes in the left and right splits, and then dividing by the total number of examples.
* **Step 3:** Use the function **error_reduction** to that you implemented earlier to write an if condition to detect whether  the reduction in error is less than the constant provided (`min_error_reduction`). Don't forget to use that argument.
* **Step 4:** Return a leaf. This line of code should be the same as the other (pre-implemented) stopping conditions.

Fill in the places where you find `## YOUR CODE HERE`. There are **seven** places in this function for you to fill in.

### Measuring the complexity of the tree

Recall in the lecture that we talked about deeper trees being more complex. We will measure the complexity of the tree as

```
  complexity(T) = number of leaves in the tree T
```

Here, we provide a function `count_leaves` that counts the number of leaves in a tree. Using this implementation, compute the number of nodes in `model_1`, `model_2`, and `model_3`.

We will compare three models trained with different values of the stopping criterion. We intentionally picked models at the extreme ends (**negative**, **just right**, and **too positive**).

Train three models with these parameters:
1. **model_4**: `min_error_reduction = -1` (ignoring this early stopping condition)
2. **model_5**: `min_error_reduction = 0` (just right)
3. **model_6**: `min_error_reduction = 5` (too positive)

For each of these three, we set `max_depth = 6`, and `min_node_size = 0`.

** Note:** Each tree can take up to 30 seconds to train.

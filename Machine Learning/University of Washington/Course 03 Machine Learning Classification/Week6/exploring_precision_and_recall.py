# Exploring precision and recall

The goal of this second notebook is to understand precision-recall in the context of classifiers.

 * Use Amazon review data in its entirety.
 * Train a logistic regression model.
 * Explore various evaluation metrics: accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall.
 * Explore how various metrics can be combined to produce a cost of making an error.
 * Explore precision and recall curves.
 
Because we are using the full Amazon review dataset (not a subset of words or reviews), in this assignment we return to using Turi Create for its efficiency. As usual, let's start by **firing up Turi Create**.

Make sure you have the latest version of Turi Create.

As in the first assignment of this course, we compute the word counts for individual words and extract positive and negative sentiments from ratings. To summarize, we perform the following:

3. Set reviews with rating 4 or more to be positive and those with 2 or less to be negative.

"""# Model Evaluation

We will explore the advanced model evaluation concepts that were discussed in the lectures.

## Accuracy

One performance metric we will use for our more advanced exploration is accuracy, which we have seen many times in past assignments.  Recall that the accuracy is given by

$$
\mbox{accuracy} = \frac{\mbox{# correctly classified data points}}{\mbox{# total data points}}
$$

To obtain the accuracy of our trained models using Turi Create, simply pass the option `metric='accuracy'` to the `evaluate` function. We compute the **accuracy** of our logistic regression model on the **test_data** as follows:
"""

accuracy= model.evaluate(test_data, metric='accuracy')['accuracy']
print("Test Accuracy: %s" % accuracy)

"""## Baseline: Majority class prediction

Recall from an earlier assignment that we used the **majority class classifier** as a baseline (i.e reference) model for a point of comparison with a more sophisticated classifier. The majority classifier model predicts the majority class for all data points. 

Typically, a good model should beat the majority class classifier. Since the majority class in this dataset is the positive class (i.e., there are more positive than negative reviews), the accuracy of the majority class classifier can be computed as follows:
"""

baseline = len(test_data[test_data['sentiment'] == 1])/len(test_data)
print("Baseline accuracy (majority class classifier): %s" % baseline)

"""**Quiz Question:** Using accuracy as the evaluation metric, was our **logistic regression model** better than the baseline (majority class classifier)?

## Confusion Matrix

The accuracy, while convenient, does not tell the whole story. For a fuller picture, we turn to the **confusion matrix**. In the case of binary classification, the confusion matrix is a 2-by-2 matrix laying out correct and incorrect predictions made in each label as follows:
```
              +---------------------------------------------+
              |                Predicted label              |
              +----------------------+----------------------+
              |          (+1)        |         (-1)         |
+-------+-----+----------------------+----------------------+
| True  |(+1) | # of true positives  | # of false negatives |
| label +-----+----------------------+----------------------+
|       |(-1) | # of false positives | # of true negatives  |
+-------+-----+----------------------+----------------------+
```
To print out the confusion matrix for a classifier, use `metric='confusion_matrix'`:
"""

"""## Computing the cost of mistakes


Put yourself in the shoes of a manufacturer that sells a baby product on Amazon.com and you want to monitor your product's reviews in order to respond to complaints.  Even a few negative reviews may generate a lot of bad publicity about the product. So you don't want to miss any reviews with negative sentiments --- you'd rather put up with false alarms about potentially negative reviews instead of missing negative reviews entirely. In other words, **false positives cost more than false negatives**. (It may be the other way around for other scenarios, but let's stick with the manufacturer's scenario for now.)

Suppose you know the costs involved in each kind of mistake: 
1. \$100 for each false positive.
2. \$1 for each false negative.
3. Correctly classified reviews incur no cost.

**Quiz Question**: Given the stipulation, what is the cost associated with the logistic regression classifier's performance on the **test set**?
"""

"""## Precision and Recall

You may not have exact dollar amounts for each kind of mistake. Instead, you may simply prefer to reduce the percentage of false positives to be less than, say, 3.5% of all positive predictions. This is where **precision** comes in:

$$
[\text{precision}] = \frac{[\text{# positive data points with positive predicitions}]}{\text{[# all data points with positive predictions]}} = \frac{[\text{# true positives}]}{[\text{# true positives}] + [\text{# false positives}]}
$$

So to keep the percentage of false positives below 3.5% of positive predictions, we must raise the precision to 96.5% or higher. 

**First**, let us compute the precision of the logistic regression classifier on the **test_data**.

false_positive/confusion_matrix['count'].sum()

"""**Quiz Question:** Based on what we learned in lecture, if we wanted to reduce this fraction of false positives to be below 3.5%, we would (select one):

- Discard a sufficient number of positive predictions
- Discard a sufficient number of negative predictins
- Increase threshold for predicting the positive class ($y_{hat} = +1$)
- Decrease threshold for predicting the positive class ($y_{hat} = +1$)

A complementary metric is **recall**, which measures the ratio between the number of true positives and that of (ground-truth) positive reviews:

$$
[\text{recall}] = \frac{[\text{# positive data points with positive predicitions}]}{\text{[# all positive data points]}} = \frac{[\text{# true positives}]}{[\text{# true positives}] + [\text{# false negatives}]}

# Precision-recall tradeoff

In this part, we will explore the trade-off between precision and recall discussed in the lecture.  We first examine what happens when we use a different threshold value for making class predictions.  We then explore a range of threshold values and plot the associated precision-recall curve.

## Varying the threshold

False positives are costly in our example, so we may want to be more conservative about making positive predictions. To achieve this, instead of thresholding class probabilities at 0.5, we can choose a higher threshold. 

Write a function called `apply_threshold` that accepts two things
* `probabilities` (an SArray of probability values)
* `threshold` (a float between 0 and 1).

The function should return an SArray, where each element is set to +1 or -1 depending whether the corresponding probability exceeds `threshold`.

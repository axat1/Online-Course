# Predicting sentiment from product reviews


The goal of this first notebook is to explore logistic regression and feature engineering with existing Turi Create functions.

In this notebook you will use product review data from Amazon.com to predict whether the sentiments about a product (from its reviews) are positive or negative.

* Use SFrames to do some feature engineering
* Train a logistic regression model to predict the sentiment of product reviews.
* Inspect the weights (coefficients) of a trained logistic regression model.
* Make a prediction (both class and probability) of sentiment for a new product review.
* Given the logistic regression weights, predictors and ground truth labels, write a function to compute the **accuracy** of the model.
* Inspect the coefficients of the logistic regression model and interpret their meanings.
* Compare multiple logistic regression models.

Let's get started!

It means that the quality metric (to be covered in Module 3) failed to improve in the last iteration of the run. The difficulty arises as the sentiment model puts too much weight on extremely rare words. A way to rectify this is to apply regularization, to be covered in Module 4. Regularization lessens the effect of extremely rare words. For the purpose of this assignment, however, please proceed with the model above.

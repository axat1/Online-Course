# Boosting a decision stump

The goal of this notebook is to implement your own boosting module.

**Brace yourselves**! This is going to be a fun and challenging assignment.


* Use SFrames to do some feature engineering.
* Modify the decision trees to incorporate weights.
* Implement Adaboost ensembling.
* Use your implementation of Adaboost to train a boosted decision stump ensemble.
* Evaluate the effect of boosting (adding more decision stumps) on performance of the model.
* Explore the robustness of Adaboost to overfitting.

Let's get started!

"""

train_data, test_data = loans_data.random_split(0.8, seed=1)

"""# Weighted decision trees

Let's modify our decision tree code from Module 5 to support weighting of individual data points.

### Weighted error definition

Consider a model with $N$ data points with:
* Predictions $\hat{y}_1 ... \hat{y}_n$ 
* Target $y_1 ... y_n$ 
* Data point weights $\alpha_1 ... \alpha_n$.

Then the **weighted error** is defined by:
$$
\mathrm{E}(\mathbf{\alpha}, \mathbf{\hat{y}}) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i \times 1[y_i \neq \hat{y_i}]}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i}
$$
where $1[y_i \neq \hat{y_i}]$ is an indicator function that is set to $1$ if $y_i \neq \hat{y_i}$.


### Write a function to compute weight of mistakes

Write a function that calculates the weight of mistakes for making the "weighted-majority" predictions for a dataset. The function accepts two inputs:
* `labels_in_node`: Targets $y_1 ... y_n$ 
* `data_weights`: Data point weights $\alpha_1 ... \alpha_n$

We are interested in computing the (total) weight of mistakes, i.e.
$$
\mathrm{WM}(\mathbf{\alpha}, \mathbf{\hat{y}}) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i \times 1[y_i \neq \hat{y_i}].
$$
This quantity is analogous to the number of mistakes, except that each mistake now carries different weight. It is related to the weighted error in the following way:
$$
\mathrm{E}(\mathbf{\alpha}, \mathbf{\hat{y}}) = \frac{\mathrm{WM}(\mathbf{\alpha}, \mathbf{\hat{y}})}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i}
$$

The function **intermediate_node_weighted_mistakes** should first compute two weights: 
 * $\mathrm{WM}_{-1}$: weight of mistakes when all predictions are $\hat{y}_i = -1$ i.e $\mathrm{WM}(\mathbf{\alpha}, \mathbf{-1}$)
 * $\mathrm{WM}_{+1}$: weight of mistakes when all predictions are $\hat{y}_i = +1$ i.e $\mbox{WM}(\mathbf{\alpha}, \mathbf{+1}$)
 
 where $\mathbf{-1}$ and $\mathbf{+1}$ are vectors where all values are -1 and +1 respectively.
 
After computing $\mathrm{WM}_{-1}$ and $\mathrm{WM}_{+1}$, the function **intermediate_node_weighted_mistakes** should return the lower of the two weights of mistakes, along with the class associated with that weight. We have provided a skeleton for you with `YOUR CODE HERE` to be filled in several places.

def intermediate_node_weighted_mistakes(labels_in_node, data_weights):

### Function to pick best feature to split on

We continue modifying our decision tree code from the earlier assignment to incorporate weighting of individual data points. The next step is to pick the best feature to split on.

The **best_splitting_feature** function is similar to the one from the earlier assignment with two minor modifications:
  1. The function **best_splitting_feature** should now accept an extra parameter `data_weights` to take account of weights of data points.
  2. Instead of computing the number of mistakes in the left and right side of the split, we compute the weight of mistakes for both sides, add up the two weights, and divide it by the total weight of the data.
  
Complete the following function. Comments starting with `DIFFERENT HERE` mark the sections where the weighted version differs from the original implementation.

**Very Optional**. Relationship between weighted error and weight of mistakes

By definition, the weighted error is the weight of mistakes divided by the weight of all data points, so
$$
\mathrm{E}(\mathbf{\alpha}, \mathbf{\hat{y}}) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i \times 1[y_i \neq \hat{y_i}]}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i} = \frac{\mathrm{WM}(\mathbf{\alpha}, \mathbf{\hat{y}})}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i}.
$$

In the code above, we obtain $\mathrm{E}(\mathbf{\alpha}, \mathbf{\hat{y}})$ from the two weights of mistakes from both sides, $\mathrm{WM}(\mathbf{\alpha}_{\mathrm{left}}, \mathbf{\hat{y}}_{\mathrm{left}})$ and $\mathrm{WM}(\mathbf{\alpha}_{\mathrm{right}}, \mathbf{\hat{y}}_{\mathrm{right}})$. First, notice that the overall weight of mistakes $\mathrm{WM}(\mathbf{\alpha}, \mathbf{\hat{y}})$ can be broken into two weights of mistakes over either side of the split:
$$
\mathrm{WM}(\mathbf{\alpha}, \mathbf{\hat{y}})
= \sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i \times 1[y_i \neq \hat{y_i}]
= \sum_{\mathrm{left}} \alpha_i \times 1[y_i \neq \hat{y_i}]
 + \sum_{\mathrm{right}} \alpha_i \times 1[y_i \neq \hat{y_i}]\\
= \mathrm{WM}(\mathbf{\alpha}_{\mathrm{left}}, \mathbf{\hat{y}}_{\mathrm{left}}) + \mathrm{WM}(\mathbf{\alpha}_{\mathrm{right}}, \mathbf{\hat{y}}_{\mathrm{right}})
$$
We then divide through by the total weight of all data points to obtain $\mathrm{E}(\mathbf{\alpha}, \mathbf{\hat{y}})$:
$$
\mathrm{E}(\mathbf{\alpha}, \mathbf{\hat{y}})
= \frac{\mathrm{WM}(\mathbf{\alpha}_{\mathrm{left}}, \mathbf{\hat{y}}_{\mathrm{left}}) + \mathrm{WM}(\mathbf{\alpha}_{\mathrm{right}}, \mathbf{\hat{y}}_{\mathrm{right}})}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i}
$$

### Building the tree

With the above functions implemented correctly, we are now ready to build our decision tree. Recall from the previous assignments that each node in the decision tree is represented as a dictionary which contains the following keys:

    { 
       'is_leaf'            : True/False.
       'prediction'         : Prediction at the leaf node.
       'left'               : (dictionary corresponding to the left tree).
       'right'              : (dictionary corresponding to the right tree).
       'features_remaining' : List of features that are posible splits.
    }
    
Let us start with a function that creates a leaf node given a set of target values:

    # Computed weight of mistakes.

    # Store the predicted class (1 or -1) in leaf['prediction']
    leaf['prediction'] = best_class ## YOUR CODE HERE
    
    return leaf

"""We provide a function that learns a weighted decision tree recursively and implements 3 stopping conditions:

Recall from the lecture that in order to make predictions, we use the following formula:
$$
\hat{y} = sign\left(\sum_{t=1}^T \hat{w}_t f_t(x)\right)

We need to do the following things:
- Compute the predictions $f_t(x)$ using the $t$-th decision tree
- Compute $\hat{w}_t f_t(x)$ by multiplying the `stump_weights` with the predictions $f_t(x)$ from the decision trees
- Sum the weighted predictions over each stump in the ensemble.

Complete the following skeleton for making predictions:

In this section, we will try to reproduce some of the performance plots dicussed in the lecture.

We will now train an ensemble with:

* `features`
* `target`
* `num_tree_stumps = 30`

Once we are done with this, we will then do the following:
* Compute the classification error at the end of each iteration.
* Plot a curve of classification error vs iteration.

# Implementing logistic regression from scratch

The goal of this notebook is to implement your own logistic regression classifier. You will:

 * Extract features from Amazon product reviews.
 * Convert an SFrame into a NumPy array.
 * Implement the link function for logistic regression.
 * Write a function to compute the derivative of the log likelihood function with respect to a single coefficient.
 * Implement gradient ascent.
 * Given a set of coefficients, predict sentiments.
 * Compute classification accuracy for the logistic regression model.
 
Let's get started!

## Apply text cleaning on the review data

In this section, we will perform some simple feature cleaning using **SFrames**. The last assignment used all words in building bag-of-words features, but here we limit ourselves to 193 words (for simplicity). We compiled a list of 193 most frequent words into a JSON file.

"""## Estimating conditional probability with link function

Recall from lecture that the link function is given by:
$$
P(y_i = +1 | \mathbf{x}_i,\mathbf{w}) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-\mathbf{w}^T h(\mathbf{x}_i))},
$$

where the feature vector $h(\mathbf{x}_i)$ represents the word counts of **important_words** in the review  $\mathbf{x}_i$. Complete the following function that implements the link function:
"""

'''
produces probablistic estimate for P(y_i = +1 | x_i, w).
estimate ranges between 0 and 1.
'''
def predict_probability(feature_matrix, coefficients):
    # Take dot product of feature_matrix and coefficients  
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    product = np.dot(feature_matrix, coefficients)
    
    # Compute P(y_i = +1 | x_i, w) using the link function
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    predictions = 1/(1 + np.exp(-product))
    
    # return predictions
    return predictions

"""**Aside**. How the link function works with matrix algebra

Since the word counts are stored as columns in **feature_matrix**, each $i$-th row of the matrix corresponds to the feature vector $h(\mathbf{x}_i)$:
$$
[\text{feature_matrix}] =
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
h(\mathbf{x}_1)^T \\
h(\mathbf{x}_2)^T \\
\vdots \\
h(\mathbf{x}_N)^T
\end{array}
\right] =
\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
h_0(\mathbf{x}_1) & h_1(\mathbf{x}_1) & \cdots & h_D(\mathbf{x}_1) \\
h_0(\mathbf{x}_2) & h_1(\mathbf{x}_2) & \cdots & h_D(\mathbf{x}_2) \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
h_0(\mathbf{x}_N) & h_1(\mathbf{x}_N) & \cdots & h_D(\mathbf{x}_N)
\end{array}
\right]
$$

By the rules of matrix multiplication, the score vector containing elements $\mathbf{w}^T h(\mathbf{x}_i)$ is obtained by multiplying **feature_matrix** and the coefficient vector $\mathbf{w}$.
$$
[\text{score}] =
[\text{feature_matrix}]\mathbf{w} =
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
h(\mathbf{x}_1)^T \\
h(\mathbf{x}_2)^T \\
\vdots \\
h(\mathbf{x}_N)^T

h(\mathbf{x}_1)^T\mathbf{w} \\
h(\mathbf{x}_2)^T\mathbf{w} \\

The log likelihood is computed using the following formula (see the advanced optional video if you are curious about the derivation of this equation):

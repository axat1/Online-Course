**Quiz Question**: In Module 3 assignment, there were 194 features (an intercept + one feature for each of the 193 important words). In this assignment, we will use stochastic gradient ascent to train the classifier using logistic regression. How does the changing the solver to stochastic gradient ascent affect the number of features?

## Building on logistic regression

Let us now build on Module 3 assignment. Recall from lecture that the link function for logistic regression can be defined as:

$$
P(y_i = +1 | \mathbf{x}_i,\mathbf{w}) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-\mathbf{w}^T h(\mathbf{x}_i))},
$$

where the feature vector $h(\mathbf{x}_i)$ is given by the word counts of **important_words** in the review $\mathbf{x}_i$. 


We will use the **same code** as in Module 3 assignment to make probability predictions, since this part is not affected by using stochastic gradient ascent as a solver. Only the way in which the coefficients are learned is affected by using stochastic gradient ascent as a solver.

    score = np.dot(feature_matrix, coefficients)
    
    # Compute P(y_i = +1 | x_i, w) using the link function
    predictions = 1. / (1.+np.exp(-score))    
    return predictions

"""## Derivative of log likelihood with respect to a single coefficient

Let us now work on making minor changes to how the derivative computation is performed for logistic regression.

Recall from the lectures and Module 3 assignment that for logistic regression, **the derivative of log likelihood with respect to a single coefficient** is as follows:

$$
\frac{\partial\ell}{\partial w_j} = \sum_{i=1}^N h_j(\mathbf{x}_i)\left(\mathbf{1}[y_i = +1] - P(y_i = +1 | \mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{w})\right)
$$

In Module 3 assignment, we wrote a function to compute the derivative of log likelihood with respect to a single coefficient $w_j$. The function accepts the following two parameters:
 * `errors` vector containing $(\mathbf{1}[y_i = +1] - P(y_i = +1 | \mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{w}))$ for all $i$
 * `feature` vector containing $h_j(\mathbf{x}_i)$  for all $i$
 
Complete the following code block:
"""

def feature_derivative(errors, feature): 
    
    # Compute the dot product of errors and feature
    ## YOUR CODE HERE
    derivative = np.dot(errors, feature)

    return derivative

"""**Note**. We are not using regularization in this assignment, but, as discussed in the optional video, stochastic gradient can also be used for regularized logistic regression.

To verify the correctness of the gradient computation, we provide a function for computing average log likelihood (which we recall from the last assignment was a topic detailed in an advanced optional video, and used here for its numerical stability).

To track the performance of stochastic gradient ascent, we provide a function for computing **average log likelihood**. 

$$\ell\ell_A(\mathbf{w}) = \color{red}{\frac{1}{N}} \sum_{i=1}^N \Big( (\mathbf{1}[y_i = +1] - 1)\mathbf{w}^T h(\mathbf{x}_i) - \ln\left(1 + \exp(-\mathbf{w}^T h(\mathbf{x}_i))\right) \Big) $$

**Note** that we made one tiny modification to the log likelihood function (called **compute_log_likelihood**) in our earlier assignments. We added a $\color{red}{1/N}$ term which averages the log likelihood accross all data points. The $\color{red}{1/N}$ term makes it easier for us to compare stochastic gradient ascent with batch gradient ascent. We will use this function to generate plots that are similar to those you saw in the lecture.
"""

def compute_avg_log_likelihood(feature_matrix, sentiment, coefficients):
    
    indicator = (sentiment==+1)
    scores = np.dot(feature_matrix, coefficients)
    logexp = np.log(1. + np.exp(-scores))
    
    # Simple check to prevent overflow
    mask = np.isinf(logexp)
    logexp[mask] = -scores[mask]
    
    lp = np.sum((indicator-1)*scores - logexp)/len(feature_matrix)
    
    return lp

"""**Quiz Question:** Recall from the lecture and the earlier assignment, the log likelihood (without the averaging term) is given by 

$$\ell\ell(\mathbf{w}) = \sum_{i=1}^N \Big( (\mathbf{1}[y_i = +1] - 1)\mathbf{w}^T h(\mathbf{x}_i) - \ln\left(1 + \exp(-\mathbf{w}^T h(\mathbf{x}_i))\right) \Big) $$

How are the functions $\ell\ell(\mathbf{w})$ and $\ell\ell_A(\mathbf{w})$ related?

## Modifying the derivative for stochastic gradient ascent

Recall from the lecture that the gradient for a single data point $\color{red}{\mathbf{x}_i}$ can be computed using the following formula:

$$
\frac{\partial\ell_{\color{red}{i}}(\mathbf{w})}{\partial w_j} = h_j(\color{red}{\mathbf{x}_i})\left(\mathbf{1}[y_\color{red}{i} = +1] - P(y_\color{red}{i} = +1 | \color{red}{\mathbf{x}_i}, \mathbf{w})\right)
$$


**Computing the gradient for a single data point**

Do we really need to re-write all our code to modify $\partial\ell(\mathbf{w})/\partial w_j$ to $\partial\ell_{\color{red}{i}}(\mathbf{w})/{\partial w_j}$? 


Thankfully **No!**. Using NumPy, we access $\mathbf{x}_i$ in the training data using `feature_matrix_train[i:i+1,:]`
and $y_i$ in the training data using `sentiment_train[i:i+1]`. We can compute $\partial\ell_{\color{red}{i}}(\mathbf{w})/\partial w_j$ by re-using **all the code** written in **feature_derivative** and **predict_probability**.


We compute $\partial\ell_{\color{red}{i}}(\mathbf{w})/\partial w_j$ using the following steps:
* First, compute $P(y_i = +1 | \mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{w})$ using the **predict_probability** function with `feature_matrix_train[i:i+1,:]` as the first parameter.
* Next, compute $\mathbf{1}[y_i = +1]$ using `sentiment_train[i:i+1]`.
* Finally, call the **feature_derivative** function with `feature_matrix_train[i:i+1, j]` as one of the parameters. 

Let us follow these steps for `j = 1` and `i = 10`:
"""

j = 1                        # Feature number
i = 10                       # Data point number
coefficients = np.zeros(194) # A point w at which we are computing the gradient.

predictions = predict_probability(feature_matrix_train[i:i+1,:], coefficients)
indicator = (sentiment_train[i:i+1]==+1)

errors = indicator - predictions        
gradient_single_data_point = feature_derivative(errors, feature_matrix_train[i:i+1,j])
print("Gradient single data point: %s" % gradient_single_data_point)
print("           --> Should print 0.0")

"""**Quiz Question:** The code block above computed $\partial\ell_{\color{red}{i}}(\mathbf{w})/{\partial w_j}$ for `j = 1` and `i = 10`.  Is $\partial\ell_{\color{red}{i}}(\mathbf{w})/{\partial w_j}$ a scalar or a 194-dimensional vector?

## Modifying the derivative for using a batch of data points

Stochastic gradient estimates the ascent direction using 1 data point, while gradient uses $N$ data points to decide how to update the parameters.  In an optional video, we discussed the details of a simple change that allows us to use a **mini-batch** of $B \leq N$ data points to estimate the ascent direction. This simple approach is faster than regular gradient but less noisy than stochastic gradient that uses only 1 data point. Although we encorage you to watch the optional video on the topic to better understand why mini-batches help stochastic gradient, in this assignment, we will simply use this technique, since the approach is very simple and will improve your results.

Given a mini-batch (or a set of data points) $\mathbf{x}_{i}, \mathbf{x}_{i+1} \ldots \mathbf{x}_{i+B}$, the gradient function for this mini-batch of data points is given by:
$$
\color{red}{\sum_{s = i}^{i+B}} \frac{\partial\ell_{s}}{\partial w_j} = \color{red}{\sum_{s = i}^{i + B}} h_j(\mathbf{x}_s)\left(\mathbf{1}[y_s = +1] - P(y_s = +1 | \mathbf{x}_s, \mathbf{w})\right)
$$


**Computing the gradient for a "mini-batch" of data points**

Using NumPy, we access the points $\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{x}_{i+1} \ldots \mathbf{x}_{i+B}$ in the training data using `feature_matrix_train[i:i+B,:]`
and $y_i$ in the training data using `sentiment_train[i:i+B]`. 

We can compute $\color{red}{\sum_{s = i}^{i+B}} \partial\ell_{s}/\partial w_j$ easily as follows:
"""

j = 1                        # Feature number
i = 10                       # Data point start
B = 10                       # Mini-batch size
coefficients = np.zeros(194) # A point w at which we are computing the gradient.

predictions = predict_probability(feature_matrix_train[i:i+B,:], coefficients)
indicator = (sentiment_train[i:i+B]==+1)

errors = indicator - predictions        
gradient_mini_batch = feature_derivative(errors, feature_matrix_train[i:i+B,j])
print("Gradient mini-batch data points: %s" % gradient_mini_batch)
print("                --> Should print 1.0")

"""**Quiz Question:** The code block above computed 
$\color{red}{\sum_{s = i}^{i+B}}\partial\ell_{s}(\mathbf{w})/{\partial w_j}$

**Quiz Question:** For what value of `B` is the term
$\color{red}{\sum_{s = 1}^{B}}\partial\ell_{s}(\mathbf{w})/\partial w_j$
the same as the full gradient
$\partial\ell(\mathbf{w})/{\partial w_j}$? Hint: consider the training set we are using now.
"""

print(len(sentiment_train))

"""### Averaging the gradient across a batch

It is a common practice to normalize the gradient update rule by the batch size B:

$$
\frac{\partial\ell_{\color{red}{A}}(\mathbf{w})}{\partial w_j} \approx \color{red}{\frac{1}{B}} {\sum_{s = i}^{i + B}} h_j(\mathbf{x}_s)\left(\mathbf{1}[y_s = +1] - P(y_s = +1 | \mathbf{x}_s, \mathbf{w})\right)
$$
In other words, we update the coefficients using the **average gradient over data points** (instead of using a summation). By using the average gradient, we ensure that the magnitude of the gradient is approximately the same for all batch sizes. This way, we can more easily compare various batch sizes of stochastic gradient ascent (including a batch size of **all the data points**), and study the effect of batch size on the algorithm as well as the choice of step size.

To compare convergence rates for stochastic gradient ascent with batch gradient ascent, we call `make_plot()` multiple times in the same cell.

* **batch gradient ascent**: `step_size = 0.5`, `batch_size=len(feature_matrix_train)`

* `batch_size=100`
* `initial_coefficients` to all zeros.

## Explore the effects of step sizes on stochastic gradient ascent

In previous sections, we chose step sizes for you. In practice, it helps to know how to choose good step sizes yourself.

To start, we explore a wide range of step sizes that are equally spaced in the log space. Run stochastic gradient ascent with `step_size` set to 1e-4, 1e-3, 1e-2, 1e-1, 1e0, 1e1, and 1e2. Use the following set of parameters:
* `initial_coefficients=np.zeros(194)`
* `batch_size=100`
* `max_iter` initialized so as to run 10 passes over the data.

## Implementing binary decision trees

The goal of this notebook is to implement your own binary decision tree classifier. You will:
    
* Use SFrames to do some feature engineering.
* Transform categorical variables into binary variables.
* Write a function to compute the number of misclassified examples in an intermediate node.
* Write a function to find the best feature to split on.
* Build a binary decision tree from scratch.
* Make predictions using the decision tree.
* Evaluate the accuracy of the decision tree.
* Visualize the decision at the root node.

**Important Note**: In this assignment, we will focus on building decision trees where the data contain **only binary (0 or 1) features**. This allows us to avoid dealing with:
* Multiple intermediate nodes in a split
* The thresholding issues of real-valued features.

This assignment **may be challenging**, so brace yourself :)

Garcia, *IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering* **21**(9) (June 26, 2009), p. 1263â€“1284. For this assignment, we use the simplest possible approach, where we subsample the overly represented class to get a more balanced dataset. In general, and especially when the data is highly imbalanced, we recommend using more advanced methods.

## Transform categorical data into binary features

In this assignment, we will implement **binary decision trees** (decision trees for binary features, a specific case of categorical variables taking on two values, e.g., true/false). Since all of our features are currently categorical features, we want to turn them into binary features. 

For instance, the **home_ownership** feature represents the home ownership status of the loanee, which is either `own`, `mortgage` or `rent`. For example, if a data point has the feature 
```
   {'home_ownership': 'RENT'}
```
we want to turn this into three features: 
```
 { 
   'home_ownership = OWN'      : 0, 
   'home_ownership = MORTGAGE' : 0, 
   'home_ownership = RENT'     : 1
 }

## Function to count number of mistakes while predicting majority class

Recall from the lecture that prediction at an intermediate node works by predicting the **majority class** for all data points that belong to this node.

Now, we will write a function that calculates the number of **missclassified examples** when predicting the **majority class**. This will be used to help determine which feature is the best to split on at a given node of the tree.

**Note**: Keep in mind that in order to compute the number of mistakes for a majority classifier, we only need the label (y values) of the data points in the node. 

** Steps to follow **:
* **Step 1:** Calculate the number of safe loans and risky loans.
* **Step 2:** Since we are assuming majority class prediction, all the data points that are **not** in the majority class are considered **mistakes**.
* **Step 3:** Return the number of **mistakes**.


Now, let us write the function `intermediate_node_num_mistakes` which computes the number of misclassified examples of an intermediate node given the set of labels (y values) of the data points contained in the node. Fill in the places where you find `## YOUR CODE HERE`. There are **three** places in this function for you to fill in.
"""

def intermediate_node_num_mistakes(labels_in_node):
    # Corner case: If labels_in_node is empty, return 0
    if len(labels_in_node) == 0:
        return 0
    
    # Count the number of 1's (safe loans)
    ## YOUR CODE HERE
    num_of_positive = (labels_in_node == +1).sum()

    # Count the number of -1's (risky loans)

    num_of_negative = (labels_in_node == -1).sum()
    
    # Return the number of mistakes that the majority classifier makes.
    ## YOUR CODE HERE

"""Because there are several steps in this assignment, we have introduced some stopping points where you can check your code and make sure it is correct before proceeding.

"""## Function to pick best feature to split on

The function **best_splitting_feature** takes 3 arguments: 
1. The data (SFrame of data which includes all of the feature columns and label column)
2. The features to consider for splits (a list of strings of column names to consider for splits)
3. The name of the target/label column (string)

The function will loop through the list of possible features, and consider splitting on each of them. It will calculate the classification error of each split and return the feature that had the smallest classification error when split on.

Recall that the **classification error** is defined as follows:
$$
\mbox{classification error} = \frac{\mbox{# mistakes}}{\mbox{# total examples}}
$$

Follow these steps: 
* **Step 1:** Loop over each feature in the feature list
* **Step 2:** Within the loop, split the data into two groups: one group where all of the data has feature value 0 or False (we will call this the **left** split), and one group where all of the data has feature value 1 or True (we will call this the **right** split). Make sure the **left** split corresponds with 0 and the **right** split corresponds with 1 to ensure your implementation fits with our implementation of the tree building process.
* **Step 3:** Calculate the number of misclassified examples in both groups of data and use the above formula to compute the **classification error**.
* **Step 4:** If the computed error is smaller than the best error found so far, store this **feature and its error**.

This may seem like a lot, but we have provided pseudocode in the comments in order to help you implement the function correctly.

**Note:** Remember that since we are only dealing with binary features, we do not have to consider thresholds for real-valued features. This makes the implementation of this function much easier.

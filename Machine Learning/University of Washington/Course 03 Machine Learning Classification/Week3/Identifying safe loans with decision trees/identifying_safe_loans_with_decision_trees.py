"""The [LendingClub](https://www.lendingclub.com/) is a peer-to-peer leading company that directly connects borrowers and potential lenders/investors. In this notebook, you will build a classification model to predict whether or not a loan provided by LendingClub is likely to [default](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_%28finance%29).

In this notebook you will use data from the LendingClub to predict whether a loan will be paid off in full or the loan will be [charged off](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge-off) and possibly go into default. In this assignment you will:

* Use SFrames to do some feature engineering.
* Train a decision-tree on the LendingClub dataset.
* Predict whether a loan will default along with prediction probabilities (on a validation set).
* Train a complex tree model and compare it to simple tree model.

Let's get started!

## Fire up Turi Create

Make sure you have the latest version of Turi Create. If you don't find the decision tree module, then you would need to upgrade Turi Create using

```
   pip install turicreate --upgrade
```
"""

!pip install turicreate

"""# Load LendingClub dataset

We will be using a dataset from the [LendingClub](https://www.lendingclub.com/). A parsed and cleaned form of the dataset is availiable [here](https://github.com/learnml/machine-learning-specialization-private). Make sure you **download the dataset** before running the following command.
"""

loans = turicreate.SFrame('/content/drive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/Machine Learning/Course 3 Machine Learning Classification/Week3/Identifying safe loans with decision trees/lending-club-data.sframe')

"""## Exploring some features

Let's quickly explore what the dataset looks like. First, let's print out the column names to see what features we have in this dataset.
"""

loans.column_names()

"""Here, we see that we have some feature columns that have to do with grade of the loan, annual income, home ownership status, etc. Let's take a look at the distribution of loan grades in the dataset."""

loans['grade'].show()

loans['sub_grade'].show()

"""We can see that over half of the loan grades are assigned values `B` or `C`. Each loan is assigned one of these grades, along with a more finely discretized feature called `sub_grade` (feel free to explore that feature column as well!). These values depend on the loan application and credit report, and determine the interest rate of the loan. More information can be found [here](https://www.lendingclub.com/public/rates-and-fees.action).

Now, let's look at a different feature.
"""

loans['home_ownership'].show()

"""This feature describes whether the loanee is mortaging, renting, or owns a home. We can see that a small percentage of the loanees own a home.

## Exploring the target column

The target column (label column) of the dataset that we are interested in is called `bad_loans`. In this column **1** means a risky (bad) loan **0** means a safe  loan.

In order to make this more intuitive and consistent with the lectures, we reassign the target to be:
* **+1** as a safe  loan, 
* **-1** as a risky (bad) loan. 

We put this in a new column called `safe_loans`.
"""

# safe_loans =  1 => safe
# safe_loans = -1 => risky
loans['safe_loans'] = loans['bad_loans'].apply(lambda x : +1 if x==0 else -1)
loans = loans.remove_column('bad_loans')

"""Now, let us explore the distribution of the column `safe_loans`. This gives us a sense of how many safe and risky loans are present in the dataset."""

loans['safe_loans'].show()

"""You should have:
* Around 81% safe loans
* Around 19% risky loans

It looks like most of these loans are safe loans (thankfully). But this does make our problem of identifying risky loans challenging.

## Features for the classification algorithm

In this assignment, we will be using a subset of features (categorical and numeric). The features we will be using are **described in the code comments** below. If you are a finance geek, the [LendingClub](https://www.lendingclub.com/) website has a lot more details about these features.

# Extract the feature columns and target column

"""What remains now is a **subset of features** and the **target** that we will use for the rest of this notebook.

## Sample data to balance classes

As we explored above, our data is disproportionally full of safe loans.  Let's create two datasets: one with just the safe loans (`safe_loans_raw`) and one with just the risky loans (`risky_loans_raw`).

print("Percentage of risky loans :",)

"""One way to combat class imbalance is to undersample the larger class until the class distribution is approximately half and half. Here, we will undersample the larger class (safe loans) in order to balance out our dataset. This means we are throwing away many data points. We used `seed=1` so everyone gets the same results."""

# Since there are fewer risky loans than safe loans, find the ratio of the sizes
# and use that percentage to undersample the safe loans.
percentage = len(risky_loans_raw)/float(len(safe_loans_raw))

"""**Note:** There are many approaches for dealing with imbalanced data, including some where we modify the learning algorithm. These approaches are beyond the scope of this course, but some of them are reviewed in this [paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5128907&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fiel5%2F69%2F5173046%2F05128907.pdf%3Farnumber%3D5128907 ). For this assignment, we use the simplest possible approach, where we subsample the overly represented class to get a more balanced dataset. In general, and especially when the data is highly imbalanced, we recommend using more advanced methods.

## Split data into training and validation sets

We split the data into training and validation sets using an 80/20 split and specifying `seed=1` so everyone gets the same results.

**Note**: In previous assignments, we have called this a **train-test split**. However, the portion of data that we don't train on will be used to help **select model parameters** (this is known as model selection). Thus, this portion of data should be called a **validation set**. Recall that examining performance of various potential models (i.e. models with different parameters) should be on validation set, while evaluation of the final selected model should always be on test data. Typically, we would also save a portion of the data (a real test set) to test our final model on or use cross-validation on the training set to select our final model. But for the learning purposes of this assignment, we won't do that.

### Quantifying the cost of mistakes

Every mistake the model makes costs money. In this section, we will try and quantify the cost of each mistake made by the model.

Assume the following:

* **False negatives**: Loans that were actually safe but were predicted to be risky. This results in an oppurtunity cost of losing a loan that would have otherwise been accepted. 
* **False positives**: Loans that were actually risky but were predicted to be safe. These are much more expensive because it results in a risky loan being given. 
* **Correct predictions**: All correct predictions don't typically incur any cost.


Let's write code that can compute the cost of mistakes made by the model. Complete the following 4 steps:
1. First, let us compute the predictions made by the model.
1. Second, compute the number of false positives.
2. Third, compute the number of false negatives.
3. Finally, compute the cost of mistakes made by the model by adding up the costs of true positives and false positives.

First, let us make predictions on `validation_data` using the `decision_tree_model`:
"""

predictions = decision_tree_model.predict(validation_data)

"""**False positives** are predictions where the model predicts +1 but the true label is -1. Complete the following code block for the number of false positives:"""

false_positive = (validation_data[validation_data['safe_loans'] != predictions]['safe_loans'] == -1).sum()
print(false_positive)

"""**False negatives** are predictions where the model predicts -1 but the true label is +1. Complete the following code block for the number of false negatives:"""

false_negative = (validation_data[validation_data['safe_loans'] != predictions]['safe_loans'] == +1).sum()
print(false_negative)

"""**Quiz Question:** Let us assume that each mistake costs money:
* Assume a cost of \$10,000 per false negative.
* Assume a cost of \$20,000 per false positive.

What is the total cost of mistakes made by `decision_tree_model` on `validation_data`?
"""

cost_of_mistakes = (false_negative*10000) + (false_positive*20000)
print(cost_of_mistakes)
